## Learned here about Hugo

### Themes as submodules

Get the latest theme version with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

learned here: [Today I Learned](http://openmetric.org/til/programming/git-pull-with-submodule/)

Customizing is never done in the actual theme, but either in a fork or by moving the changed layout files into the base layout folder.

For the second approach see here: [Customizing a Theme](https://bwaycer.github.io/hugo_tutorial.hugo/themes/customizing/)
