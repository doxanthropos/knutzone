- [Monoton und Minimal](https://ikonoklastik.wordpress.com/ "A blog where I wrote some technical stuff in german")
- [Seeker of Something ..](https://doxanthropos.wordpress.com/ "A blog, where I wrote some nontechnical stuff in english")
- [Fragmented Notes](https://doxanthropos.github.io/ "A blog with some technical stuff, hosted on github, as the url clearly indicates. My first endeaver into the lands of static site generators. In this case Octopress")
- [Algorithmic Shards](https://blog.doxanthropos.com/ "A Tumblr focused mostly on creative coding")
- [Doxanthropos A personal weblog](http://doxanthropos.com/ "The last site before this one. A blog, as is probably obvious from the title")
