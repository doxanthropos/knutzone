In the wake of the 2023 Twitter exodus many people have started searching for a way to keep up to date with news sites, blogs and other media that they followed through Twitter. 

## Finding the Feeds

### Mastodon

### Youtube

### Vimeo

Vimeo seems to have removed the link to their rss feeds, but you can find them, by adding "/videos/rss" to a channel url, like:

[https://vimeo.com/reas/videos/rss](https://vimeo.com/reas/videos/rss)

for the channel:

[https://vimeo.com/reas/](https://vimeo.com/reas/)
